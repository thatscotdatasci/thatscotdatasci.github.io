Hello, and welcome to my website. I'm a Chemical Engineer by background, but a data nerd by vocation and heart.

After 3 years working for each of BP and Deloitte as a developer, data engineer and data scientist, I returned to the world of academia to pursue an [MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge in 2021/22, for which I obtained a Distinction.

I'm currently looking for a new role which combines my skills and passions. Ideally, this would be as a Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer or Modelling Specialist in sectors relating to energy, renewables, infrastructure, or any other engineering field.

Find out more [about me](/about), explore my [portfolio](/portfolio), and take a look at my [wiki](/wiki).

You can get in touch by [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) or any social media channel via the links in the footer.
