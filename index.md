Hello, and welcome to my website. I'm a Chemical Engineer by background, but a data nerd by vocation and heart. After 3 years working for each of BP and Deloitte as a developer, data engineer and data scientist, I've returned to the world of academia to pursue an [MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge.

Find out more [about me](/about), explore my [portfolio](/portfolio), and take a look at my [wiki](/wiki).

You can get in touch by [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) or any social media channel via the links in the footer.
