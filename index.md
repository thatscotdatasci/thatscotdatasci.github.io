Hello, and welcome to my website. I'm a Chemical Engineer by background, but a data nerd by vocation and heart. I currently work for Deloitte as a Data Engineer and Scientist, and spend a lot of my time further improving my Data Science skillset.

Feel free to find our more [about me](/about), visit my [blog](/blog), and take a look at my [wiki](/wiki).

You can get in touch via [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) or any social media channel - links can be found below.
