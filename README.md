## Welcome to the code behind the TSDS website!

Hello, you have found the code for my website [thatscotdatasci.com](https://thatscotdatasci.com).

## Such thing as a free lunch?

Fun fact: I'm paying absolutely nothing to host this website! This is because I'm making use of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## More Jekyll than Hyde

GitHub Pages supports the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) framework. Quoting from Wikipedia:

> _Jeyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder, it is distributed under an open source license._

I'm by no means a web developer, so the Jekyll framework has been a massive help in creating this site.

## More than just a blog

One feature of Jekyll I would highlight especially is [collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/). Quoting from Jekyll:

> _Collections allow you to define a new type of document that behave like Pages or Posts do normally, but also have their own unique properties and namespace._

An example of the use of collections can be found in my [wiki](https://thatscotdatasci.com/wiki).

## Recognition

When I first created this page I took advantage of the fact that you can [add a Jekyll theme to your GitHub Pages site](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-jekyll-theme-to-your-github-pages-site/). In my case, I used the [Cayman](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman) theme.

However, once I'd gotten to grips with the basics of Jekyll, I was keen to go my own way. Whilst it is possible to [customise CSS in your Jekyll theme](https://help.github.com/articles/customizing-css-and-html-in-your-jekyll-theme/), I planned to significantly overhaul the styling, and so directly imported the stylesheets from the Cayman theme into my project and stopped inheriting the CC0 licensed theme altogether.

I'm extremely grateful to the developers of Cayman for giving me my starting point.
