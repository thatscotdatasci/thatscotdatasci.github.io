This project was conducted for the Designing Intelligent Interactive Systems module of the [MPhil Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge.

<!-- I used my background and passion for engineering in the energy industry to formulate the problem statement, and my software, modelling, and data science skills to lead the execution of the project with a fantastic team. -->

The report, which achieved a distinction grade, can be downloaded [here](downloads/Home_Energy_Management_with_BEVs.pdf).
