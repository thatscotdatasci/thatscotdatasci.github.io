This project was conducted for the [Machine Learning in the Physical World](https://mlatcl.github.io/mlphysical/) module of the [MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge.

I used my background and passion for engineering in the energy industry to formulate the problem statement, and my software, modelling, and data science skills to lead the execution of the project with a fantastic team.

The report achieved an A+, with the assessors commenting "All in all, the project was a tour de force." It can be downloaded [here](downloads/Batteries_Not_Included.pdf).
