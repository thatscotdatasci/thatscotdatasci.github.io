From September 2019 until April 2020 I completed a 12 week data science bootcamp with [Cambridge Spark](https://cambridgespark.com/).
This culminated in a capstone project, which I completed with agriculture AI firm [SmartBell](http://www.smartbell.io/).

The aim of the project was to train object detection models on video footage of calves within an enclosed, undercover rearing area.
It was demonstrated that by performing transfer learning with TensorFlow using a relatively small selection of manually tagged frames, models able to detect calves, their heads and shelter entrances could be developed.
The trained models detected around 90 % of objects in a frame on average, and were used to generate metrics detailing: the number of calves in view over a given period of time; the number of these that were within a shelter; and the number with their heads low to the ground â€“ a potential indicator of illness.
