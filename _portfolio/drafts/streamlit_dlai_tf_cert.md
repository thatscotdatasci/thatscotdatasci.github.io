Interactive examples from the [DeepLearning.AI TensforFlow Developer Professional Certiicate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice) course,
including my own investigations to gain a deeper understanding of the course content.

**Please note:** It might take ~ 30 seconds for the app to load - I'm using the free tier of Heroku, and so the app goes to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity.
