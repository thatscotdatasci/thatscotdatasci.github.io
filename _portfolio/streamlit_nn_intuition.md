Some intuitions about neural networks - based on notes from Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

**Please note:** It might take ~ 30 seconds for the app to load - I'm using the free tier of Heroku, and so the app goes to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity.
