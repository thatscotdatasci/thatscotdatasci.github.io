A super simple, starter for 10 Streamlit app with the purpose of demoing functionality, and documenting how to do some cool stuff.
Includes a guide to deploying a Streamlit app to Heroku via a CI/CD pipeline implemented using GitHub Actions.

**Please note:** It might take ~ 30 seconds for the app to load - I'm using the free tier of Heroku, and so the app goes to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity.
