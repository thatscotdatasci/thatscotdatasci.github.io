If it's been a couple of months, I can never remember the order of the command to run a site locally:

``` bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Further details can be found in the [GitHub Pages docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).
