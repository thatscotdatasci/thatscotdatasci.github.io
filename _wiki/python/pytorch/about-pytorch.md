[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a python package that provides two high-level features:

Tensor computation (like numpy) with strong GPU acceleration
Deep Neural Networks built on a tape-based autodiff system
You can reuse your favorite python packages such as numpy, scipy and Cython to extend PyTorch when needed.
