The below table outlines a number of the AI/Machine Learning/Big Data libraries that are available:

| Library | Website | Wiki Article | Description |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| TensorFlow | [Link](https://www.tensorflow.org/) | [Link](/wiki/python/tensorflow/about-tensorflow) | TensorFlow is an open source software library for high performance numerical computation. Its flexible architecture allows easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge devices. Originally developed by researchers and engineers from the Google Brain team within Googleâ€™s AI organization, it comes with strong support for machine learning and deep learning and the flexible numerical computation core is used across many other scientific domains. |
| Gluon | [Link](https://github.com/gluon-api/gluon-api/) | [Link](/wiki/python/gluon/about-gluon) | The Gluon API specification is an effort to improve speed, flexibility, and accessibility of deep learning technology for all developers, regardless of their deep learning framework of choice. The Gluon API offers a flexible interface that simplifies the process of prototyping, building, and training deep learning models without sacrificing training speed. |
| Theano | [Link](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) | [Link](/wiki/python/theano/about-theano) | Theano is a Python library that lets you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions, especially ones with multi-dimensional arrays (numpy.ndarray). Using Theano it is possible to attain speeds rivaling hand-crafted C implementations for problems involving large amounts of data. It can also surpass C on a CPU by many orders of magnitude by taking advantage of recent GPUs. |
| PyTorch | [Link](https://pytorch.org/) | [Link](/wiki/python/pytorch/about-pytorch) | PyTorch is a python package that provides two high-level features:<br><br>- Tensor computation (like numpy) with strong GPU acceleration<br>- Deep Neural Networks built on a tape-based autodiff system<br><br> You can reuse your favourite python packages such as numpy, scipy and Cython to extend PyTorch when needed. |
| Keras | [Link](https://keras.io/) | [Link](/wiki/python/keras/about-keras) | Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research. |
