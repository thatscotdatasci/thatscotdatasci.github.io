Some key features of [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) are:

- Simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis
- Accessible to everybody, and reusable in various contexts
- Built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib
- Open source, commercially usable - BSD license

From [Igor Bobriakov on Medium](https://medium.com/activewizards-machine-learning-company/top-15-python-libraries-for-data-science-in-in-2017-ab61b4f9b4a7):


> Scikits are additional packages of SciPy Stack designed for specific functionalities like image processing and machine learning facilitation. In the regard of the latter, one of the most prominent of these packages is scikit-learn. The package is built on the top of SciPy and makes heavy use of its math operations.
>
> The scikit-learn exposes a concise and consistent interface to the common machine learning algorithms, making it simple to bring ML into production systems. The library combines quality code and good documentation, ease of use and high performance and is de-facto industry standard for machine learning with Python.
