I've been loosely aware of various new features introduced to Terraform during 2020 with the release of 0.13 and 0.14;
with a few hours to spare, I create the following pages in my wiki to summarise the latest features:

- [New features in 0.13]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _wiki/terraform/tf_013_releases_highlights.md %})
- [New features in 0.14]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _wiki/terraform/tf_014_releases_highlights.md %})
