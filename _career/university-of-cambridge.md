Awarded an MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence (MLMI), with Distinction. Member of Jesus College.

The MLMI MPhil is an elite 11 month programme with a small cohort of about 30 students each year. Due to its small size there is the opportunity to carry out PhD-like research projects on the course, as well having a number of bespoke taught modules with lots of opportunities to interact with the faculty and other members of the course.

See my [portfolio](/portfolio) for examples of the projects I completed, including my thesis.
