Member of the Consulting Product Factory; creating data-driven solutions for the market. Applied extensive software engineering experience to ensure that data science models adhered to coding best practices, were production ready, and supportable. Containerised models and implemented interfaces to make them “plug-and-play”; enabling swift integration into software applications and UI frameworks. Authored Python frameworks to accelerate the data science workflow; dramatically reducing time to production. These frameworks automated: the management of data ingress and egress from a variety of data stores (databases, cloud-based file stores, etc.) and the production of data audit reports; error handling and monitoring of model performance; and the preparation of model results for consumption by downstream applications. Managed JSON Schema definitions for consuming and validating client data and configuration; and developed extract, transform and load processes. And, as a DevOps and Cloud specialist, aided developers in deploying solutions via Azure DevOps pipelines using frameworks such as Terraform and Serverless.
