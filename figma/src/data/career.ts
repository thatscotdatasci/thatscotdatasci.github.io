Containerised models and implemented interfaces to make them "plug-and-play"; enabling swift integration into software applications and UI frameworks. Authored Python frameworks to accelerate the data science workflow; dramatically reducing time to production. These frameworks automated: the management of data ingress and egress from a variety of data stores (databases, cloud-based file stores, etc.) and the production of data audit reports; error handling and monitoring of model performance; and the preparation of model results for consumption by downstream applications. Managed JSON Schema definitions for consuming and validating client data and configuration; and developed extract, transform and load processes. And, as a DevOps and Cloud specialist, aided developers in deploying solutions via Azure DevOps pipelines using frameworks such as Terraform and Serverless.'
